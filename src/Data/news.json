Prior to the COVID outbreak, the team was planning on competing at a tournament in Knoxville, TN. The team was excited to compete at an outdoor tournament, but it was unfortunately canceled due to social distancing orders. While the Michigan Water Polo team is still unsure how we had 2 seasons cut short due to contagious outbreaks, we are taking it in stride and looking forward to next year. Stay safe and Go Blue!"

        "content": "We started practices in late August, working hard on our conditioning and fundamentals into the month of September. The weekend of September 20th, we travelled to East Lansing to take on Michigan State and Ohio State in the Spartan Invite preseason tune-up tournament. We lost to Michigan State in overtime, 10-9, and were defeated by the Buckeyes in a close one, 12-9\n\nIn the weeks that followed, our season took a dramatic turn. A parasitic outbreak at Canham Natatorium sidelined our team for over three weeks. During this time, we were unable to practice and were not allowed to travel to both the Big Ten east regional tournament at Michigan State and the Big Ten crossover tournament at Indiana due to concerns over cross-contamination, making our regular season record 0-0. We unfortunately were unable to host the Big Ten championship tournament at Canham as was originally scheduled due to this public health crisis.\n\nAfter our team was medically cleared, we travelled to Purdue University for the Big Ten championship tournament, where we were seeded fourth. We defeated Illinois in the first round, 13-5. In the semifinals, despite not having practiced in three weeks, we forced the number-one seed Michigan State to double overtime before eventually losing, 9-8. We finished the third place game with a 16-4 win over Wisconsin and thus concluded our season.\n\nUnfortunately, this marked our first season in five years that did not end with a Big Ten Championship. However, our boys showed a tremendous amount of grit and determination in what was truly a valiant effort. We plan on competing in several invitational tournaments this offseason, and will be even more hungry next year.\n\nWe would like to thank our fans for their support all season and send our seniors a thank you for all of their hard work over the past 4 seasons. Although this is a minor setback, one thing that we can say with confidence is that we will be back.\n\nGo Blue!"
